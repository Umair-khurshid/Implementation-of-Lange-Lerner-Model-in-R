# Implementation of Lange-Lerner Model in R

This code provides a basic implementation of the Oskar Lange model using the optim() function in R. It sets up the optimization problem with the objective function and constraint function, solves the problem using the Nelder-Mead method, and then updates the prices and allocations based on the solution. Finally, it prints the final prices and goods allocation.

To make it work for you make modifications and additions based on the specific requirements of your model and the data you are working with.
